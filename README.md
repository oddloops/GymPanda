# GymPanda
A workout tracking website that records personal records for weightlifting exercises. 

It allows users to create an account and easily enter and update the exercise name, body part worked, weight lifted, rep and set amount, and the date achieved. 

This web application is hosted using Heroku(https://sisyphuscycle.herokuapp.com/) and JawsDB though an error may occur due to resource allocation being turned off.
